# Lexical Masks

This project introduces Lexical Masks as defined in the following paper:

  https://research.google/pubs/pub49018

It includes a few lexical masks in the directory mask, as well as a script to
transform the masks into ShEx files that can be used on lexicographic entries
in Wikidata.

Further masks are more than welcome, as well as improvements to the scrips.

Open tasks:
- A script to translate the Masks to Wikidata Lexeme Forms
- A script to validate and check the masks
- Scripts to translate masks to other formalisms
